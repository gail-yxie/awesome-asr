# ASR & Speech Language Daily Update — 2026-02-22

## Summary

Although no major papers or models were released in this specific 24-hour window, the speech research community remains centered on the rapid evolution of large-scale speech-language models (SLMs) that integrate audio natively into the transformer backbone. Current industry trajectories are heavily prioritizing the refinement of discrete neural audio codecs to better capture paralinguistic nuances while maintaining low-latency inference for real-time conversational AI. This period of relative stability likely reflects a consolidation phase as practitioners move away from traditional cascading ASR-TTS pipelines toward unified, multi-modal architectures capable of end-to-end expressive synthesis.
