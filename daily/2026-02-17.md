# ASR Daily Update — 2026-02-17

## Summary

Today saw several notable developments in ASR research. A new paper proposes a streaming Conformer variant that achieves sub-100ms latency while maintaining competitive WER on LibriSpeech. Meanwhile, HuggingFace saw the release of a fine-tuned Whisper model optimized for medical transcription, and a new multilingual dataset covering 15 low-resource African languages was published.

## Key Ideas

- Streaming ASR can now achieve sub-100ms latency without significant quality degradation using chunked attention patterns
- Domain-specific fine-tuning of Whisper continues to show strong results, particularly for medical terminology
- The gap in ASR performance for low-resource African languages is being actively addressed with new curated datasets
- Self-supervised pre-training on unlabeled speech data remains the most effective approach for low-resource settings
