  "summary": "Notable ASR research today includes a comprehensive analysis of the Pashto Common Voice dataset documenting its growth from 1.5 hours to 2,769 hours, and a study on enabling ASR for disordered Akan speech with a new 50-hour corpus. The DAMA framework for depth-aware model adaptation shows strong results across 18 low-resource languages with 80% fewer trainable parameters.",
  "ideas": [
    "Depth-aware adaptation (DAMA) reveals a U-shaped adaptability pattern in speech models: early and late layers need more adaptation while intermediate layers retain shared semantics",
    "Community-driven datasets like Common Voice show extreme contributor inequality (Gini 0.941 for Pashto), highlighting the need for diversified data collection",
    "Disordered speech ASR remains a critical gap, with new curated corpora emerging for underrepresented languages"
